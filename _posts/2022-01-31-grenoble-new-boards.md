We are very happy to announce the release of new boards on the Grenoble site.

You will find two new LoRa development boards:

* [Nucleo WL55JC]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/nucleo-wl55jc.md %})
* [SAMR34 Xplained Pro evaluation kit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/microchip-samr34.md %})

As a reminder, a [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) LoRa gateway is deployed on the Grenoble site which allows you to follow the tutorials on [Labs](https://labs.iot-lab.info).

We have also deployed embedded Linux boards based on Raspberry Pi hardware. The boards are equipped with a co-microcontroller (i.e. SAMR21 Xplained Pro) to manage 802.15.4 communications.

* [Raspberry Pi 3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/raspberry-pi-3.md %})

For more details on the deployment, please have a look at the [Grenoble site deployment page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/deployment/grenoble.md %}).

We recall that adding support for new boards can be done by anyone: just follow our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/boards/add-new-board.md %}).

We hope you will enjoy working with these new boards.
